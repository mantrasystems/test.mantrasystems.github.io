              <p>Risk management is a cornerstone of EU MDR 2017/745, requiring a continuous, well-documented approach to ensure patient safety. This article unpacks the key requirements and provides actionable strategies for compliance.</p>

<p><a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/risk-management">Risk management</a> is a significant component of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU MDR 2017/745</a> and is vital to ensure the safety of patients and medical device users. A thorough approach to risk management activities is essential for medical device manufacturers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of the EU MDR. In this article, we will explore the requirements placed on medical device manufacturers by the EU MDR and provide an overview on how to address them.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-requirements">What are the requirements?</h2>

<p>Article 10, point 2 of the EU MDR stipulates that manufacturers are required to establish, document, implement and maintain a system for risk management. It can therefore be clearly interpreted that risk management must be an ongoing process throughout the lifecycle of a device, rather than a âone-offâ exercise. A continuous approach to risk management is pivotal in ensuring compliance with regulatory complaints and, moreover, safeguarding patients and device users from avoidable harm.</p>

<p>A more detailed breakdown of risk management requirements can be found in Annex I, points 2-8 of the EU MDR. In summary, the points stipulate that manufacturers must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce risks as far as possible without negatively affecting the benefit/risk profile of a device.</li>
  <li>Establish, document, implement and maintain a risk management system throughout the entire lifecycle of a device. This process includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Development of a risk management plan</li>
      <li>Identification of known and foreseeable hazards associated with the device</li>
      <li>Evaluation of risks associated with the device during intended and reasonably foreseeable misuse</li>
      <li>Implementation of measures to control or eliminate identified risks</li>
      <li>Incorporation of information gathered during device production and <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-surveillance-pms">post-market surveillance (PMS)</a> regarding the frequency of identified risks</li>
      <li>Implementation/amendment of risk control measures to address new risks, or risks with greater frequency than initially forecast, based on information obtained through PMS activities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Manage risks to an extent that the residual risk associated with each hazard, and the overall residual risk of a device, is acceptable.</li>
  <li>Inform users of any residual risks</li>
  <li>Reduce or eliminate risks relating to user error</li>
  <li>Ensure that the safety of patients and device users is not affected by the impact of stresses and environmental factors on device performance under normal conditions of use throughout the lifetime of the device.</li>
  <li>Design, manufacture and package devices in a manner that ensures their characteristics and performance are not affected during storage and transport.</li>
  <li>Ensure that all foreseeable risks and undesirable side effects are reduced as far as possible and deemed acceptable when weighed against the benefit of a device to patients and users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Annex I, point 9 refers to the requirement for devices without an intended medical purpose, as outlined in Annex XVI, to present no risk at all or a risk that is no greater than the maximum acceptable risk related to the deviceâs use. Interpretation of this statement would infer that, for devices without an intended medical purpose that remain governed by MDR, the level of acceptable risk is minimal. Devices falling under this bracket include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact lenses and other products intended to be introduced onto or into the eye</li>
  <li>Products intended to be totally or partially inserted into the body through surgically invasive means for modifying anatomy or the fixation of body parts, excluding tattooing products and piercings</li>
  <li>Facial, dermal or mucous membrane fillers</li>
  <li>Equipment for the destruction, reduction of removal of adipose tissue, such as those used in liposuction and lipolysis</li>
  <li>Equipment emitting high-intensity electromagnetic radiation for use on the human body, such as lasers and pulsed light equipment used in skin resurfacing, tattoo or hair removal</li>
  <li>Equipment intended to modify neuronal activity in the brain by applying electrical currents or magnetic or electromagnetic fields that penetrate the cranium</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-we-meet-the-requirements">How do we meet the requirements?</h2>

<p>One approach to meeting the requirements for risk management is to align risk management procedures with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quick-guide-iso-14971-risk-management-mantrasystems-xwtne/">BS EN ISO 14971</a>, since the standard is aligned with the General Safety and Performance Requirements of the EU MDR.</p>

<p>BS EN ISO 14971 describes 6 distinct steps in the overall risk management process, as demonstrated below:</p>

<h2 id="risk-management-plan">Risk Management Plan</h2>

<p>It is essential that all activities conducted during risk management are planned and that this plan is documented. A robust risk management plan will describe the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assignment of responsibilities and authorities for risk management processes.</li>
  <li>A roadmap for risk management activities to be conducted, based on the 6 defined process steps in BS EN ISO 14971.</li>
  <li>A procedure for the identification and analysis of risks associated with the device throughout its lifetime.</li>
  <li>Criteria for determination of risk acceptability.</li>
  <li>A procedure for the identification and implementation of appropriate risk control measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>A procedure for the evaluation of individual and overall residual risks following the implementation of risk control measures.</p>

<p>A process for the collection and review of production and post-production information.</p>

<h2 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h2>

<p>Risk assessment involves the analysis of risks by identifying all relevant hazards, hazardous situations and harms, and estimating the probability and severity of identified risks. In order to provide a framework for the identification of risks, it is beneficial to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Definition of intended use:
    <ul>
      <li>Intended medical indication and target medical condition</li>
      <li>Target patient population
        <ul>
          <li>Demographics</li>
          <li>Disease state and stage</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Part of body/type of tissue the device interacts with</li>
      <li>Device user profile
        <ul>
          <li>Age</li>
          <li>Medical professionals and/or laypersons</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use environment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Definition of reasonably foreseeable misuse:
    <ul>
      <li>Accidental use error</li>
      <li>Use under the wrong conditions</li>
      <li>Impact of intentional misuse</li>
      <li>Use for non-intended clinical indications</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Characteristics related to safety</li>
</ul>

<p>A comprehensive list of hazards, hazardous situations and associated harms can be identified following the definition of intended use, reasonably foreseeable misuse and characteristics related to safety. According to the definitions in BS EN ISO 14971, a hazard cannot result in harm until a sequence of events or circumstances (including normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse) leads to a hazardous situation. Each hazard (e.g. device size too small) can be associated with several hazardous situations (e.g. pressure of device against skin), each associated with several potential harms (e.g. skin abrasion). Once a risk has been followed through from hazard to harm, it can be assessed by estimating both severity and probability of occurrence of harm that could result. A pre-determined criteria of risk acceptability, as documented in the risk management plan, can then be applied based on the estimated risk probability and severity.</p>

<h2 id="risk-control">Risk control</h2>

<p>The application of appropriate risk control measures to reduce the probability and/or severity of each identified potential harm, regardless of initial evaluation of acceptability, is required. This process ensures that each identified risk has been reduced as far as possible, without negatively affecting the overall benefit-risk profile of the device.</p>

<p><a href="/enable-ce-mark/online-video-training-courses/risk-management">BS EN ISO 14971</a> sets out 3 broad risk control options for medical device manufacturers, in descending order of effectiveness, as described below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elimination of risk through design of the device. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Design without sharp edges</li>
      <li>Make dangerous electrical equipment inaccessible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reduction of risk through the addition of protective measures in the medical device itself or in the manufacturing process. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Alarms</li>
      <li>Protective covers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reduction of risk through the provision of information for the safety of device users/operators. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Warnings/precautions</li>
      <li>Promotion of use of protective equipment</li>
      <li>Instructions for use</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evaluation-of-residual-risk">Evaluation of Residual Risk</h2>

<p>Following the implementation of control measures to each identified risk, the probability and severity of each individual risk can be re-estimated, and the previously documented risk acceptability criteria re-applied to determine individual residual risks.</p>

<p>Risk management requirements under the EU MDR place an onus on manufacturers to also assess overall residual risk, whereby the acceptability of all residual risks taken together must be determined.  As is the case when determining the acceptability of individual risks, a pre-determined criteria of acceptability must be documented and followed when evaluating overall residual risk. The assessment of overall residual risk should consider the distribution of individual residual risks by acceptability category. For example, even in the absence of any unacceptable individual risks, if a significant proportion of individual risks are considered âborderlineâ the overall residual risk associated with a device may be deemed unacceptable. If this is the case, manufacturers must implement additional risk control measures, consider modifying the device design and manufacturing process, or place restrictions on the intended use or users, before re-evaluating individual and overall residual risks.</p>

<p>Manufacturers are required to disclose any significant residual risks by providing relevant information in the device labelling and Instructions for Use documentation. The disclosure of residual risks should not be confused with information for safety, which forms part of the risk control process. The disclosure of residual risk does not in itself provide information which can reduce the probability or severity of a given risk, instead providing users with an overview of the risks associated with a device that remain after risk control measures have been implemented. Further guidance on the disclosure of residual risk, and information for safety, can be found in ISO/TR 24971.</p>

<h2 id="risk-management-review">Risk Management Review</h2>

<p>Once all the risk management activities described above have completed, manufacturers are required to conduct a risk management review. The review must assess whether all procedures in the Risk Management Plan were adhered to and a robust conclusion that the overall residual risk of the device is acceptable must be made. Finally, practices for the collection and assessment of production and post-production information relating to the risk of the device must be decided on and documented. The processes and conclusions of the risk management review must be documented in a Risk Management Report.</p>

<h2 id="production-and-post-production-activities">Production and Post-Production Activities</h2>

<p>BS EN ISO 14971 describes the requirement for manufacturers to implement, document and maintain a system to collect and analyse information relating to the safety of a medical device during its production and post-production phases.</p>

<p>The collection of relevant information should encompass feedback and data from a variety of sources, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information from the supply chain relating to production and distribution of the device.</li>
  <li>Information gathered during the production process.</li>
  <li>Information from those responsible for installation and maintenance of the device.</li>
  <li>Information from users of the device.</li>
  <li>Information relating to the device or similar devices which is publicly available.</li>
  <li>Information regarding updates to the state of the art.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the relevant information has been collected, it must be subject to a formal review, with a focus on relevance of the information to the safety of the subject device. The review should identify the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any hazards or hazardous situations that were not addressed during initial risk management procedures.</li>
  <li>Previously addressed hazardous situations which have become unacceptable due to the impact of collected information.</li>
  <li>If the overall residual risk remains acceptable or is now unacceptable.</li>
  <li>Updates to the acknowledged state of the art which may impact the safety profile of the device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following a review of information gathered during production and post-production activities, manufacturers must determine whether any action is required. This process should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review of the risk management file and reassessment of previously identified risks for appropriateness of the estimated severity and probability.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of new identified risks with a determination of risk acceptability, implementation of risk control measures and assessment of residual risk as previously carried out.</li>
  <li>Reassessment of overall residual risk of the device.</li>
  <li>Determination of whether actions related to already marketed devices, such as device recall, are required based on new information.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of the impact of new information on previous risk management activities.</li>
  <li>A determination of the suitability of risk management procedures by top management.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The EU MDR places significant risk management requirements on manufacturers of all medical devices. In order to demonstrate compliance, a detailed, well-documented. procedure-driven approach to all aspects of risk management must be implemented. In addition, risk management procedures must be viewed as an ongoing process throughout the lifetime of a device, rather than a one-off exercise.</p>

<p>Though risk management compliance may seem daunting for manufacturers, embracing the requirements is an opportunity for manufacturers to support the safety of their device, and to utilise the data gathered to adopt a strong position in the market.</p>
